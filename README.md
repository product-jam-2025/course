# Digital Product Jam

This repository holds software development course materials for _Digital Product
Jam_ - a joint course run by
[Bezalel Academy of Art and Design](https://www.bezalel.ac.il/en) and the
[Hebrew University](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=hebrew+universoity&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8).

## Description

We all engage with digital products in daily life: we work with them, we express
ourselves with them, communicate through them and discover information with
them.

Students in the course will work with "real world" clients to learn about their
audience and needs, and present them with solutions in the form of digital
products, which they will design, develop, and deploy.

### Course Outline

General structure of the course will be:

1. Learn web technologies
2. Meet the "client" organizations
3. Form teams
4. Pitch and plan the product
5. Build the product!

### Course Goals

- Experience working in teams of designers and developers similar to "real" work
  in the software industry
- Experience design, development and product management with "real" clients
  while building working products for "social good" organizations
- Learn the application of web technologies towards the delivery and deployment
  of a functional product

## Discussion

### Discussion Forum

We encourage you to ask questions and discuss technical issues with your
classmates and the course staff. You can do that on the
[discussion forum for the course](https://github.com/product-jam-2025/course/discussions).

### Office Hours

If you need help with any of the course materials, you can attend office hours.
Office hours are held before classs on wednesdays or online via Google Meet, by
emailing the course staff to schedule.

## Assignments

- All technical assignments will be
  [added here](https://github.com/product-jam-2025/course/tree/main/assignments)

The majority of the grading of the course is related to team work. However,
there are a number of assignments related to software development, where you are
graded individually. These assignments must be submitted in the following way:

- All code must be commited to _your own_ code repository (which is either a
  "copy" or a "fork" of an original codebase for the assignment), hosted on
  GitHub
- The application must be deployed and accessible via a public URL (this will
  happen automatically if Vercel is configured correctly for your application,
  but you should also verify on a per-assignment basis)
- On completion, submit your task by adding a comment with the following
  information to the open issue for the task
  [here](https://github.com/product-jam-2025/course/issues):
  - the URL to your GitHub repository
  - the public URL of the working application
- All tasks must be submitted by end of day on the Tuesday before the class
  (class is on Wednesday)
