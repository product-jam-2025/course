# 01 - Personal Website

**Due November 6**

The goal of the assignment is to get you to do some basic HTML and CSS editing
to create a web page, and then deploy that to the web. This will demonstrate a
basic understanding of JavaScript and web technologies.

## Tasks

### Setup

1. Create your own copy of the
   [ex1 template repository](https://github.com/product-jam-2025/ex1-template):

   - Do this by following the steps described over here:
     [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)
   - Give your repository a name that is unique to you, for example
     `jon-website`
   - Make sure your copy lives under your own username, i.e.:
     `https://github.com/<your_user>/<repo_name>`

2. Clone the remote repository to your local computer using Git from your
   development machine:
   - **[git clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)**
3. Visit the repository directory on your local filesystem, and open it in VS
   Code
   - [via the command line](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/command-line#_launching-from-command-line)
   - or [via the app](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/basics)
4. You should now have VS Code open at the folder of the Git repository that you
   cloned from your GitHub account. Click on the `README.md` file to open it in
   VS Code.
5. Follow the instructions in the `README.md` file to:
   - Install project dependencies
   - Run the server
   - See the running app in a browser

### Add content to the HTML

1. Open index.html

- **Content**: remove the demo content and add your own instead. It can be about
  yourself, a pet, or anything, it doesn't matter.
- **HTML**: Use all of the following HTML elements in your page, with your new
  content ([see our reference materials for HTML](./../reference/html.md)):
  - `<div>` `<p>` `<br>` `<a>` `<ul>` `<h1>` `<img>` `<strong>` `<em>`
    `<iframe>`

### Style using CSS

- **CSS**: Use CSS to add some styling to your html markup
  ([see our reference materials for CSS](./../reference/css.md)):
  - Give the entire page a different "background color"
  - Change the "font size" of all content inside `<h1>` elements
  - Change the "font family" of all content inside `<p>` elements

### Add interactivity with JavaScript

- **JavaScript**: Use JavaScript to create a very simple interaction
  ([see our reference materials for JavaScript](./../reference/javascript.md)).
  Some simple ideas you could try:
  - Toggle between "showing" or "hiding" multiple HTML elements, when a website
    visitor clicks a button
  - Change the "background color" of the page, and the "color" of all text, when
    a visitor clicks a (different) button

### Deploy your web page

- **Git**: Once you have made the changes you want, and your code works locally,
  you need to "commit" your changes with Git, and "push" your changes to GitHub
  ([see reference material for git](./../reference/git.md)).

We use [Vercel](https://vercel.com) to host all our web pages and apps on the
Internet. Pushing code to a web hosting service is generally called
"deployment". The steps below need to be completed in order to deploy your code
to Vercel, and thereby get a public URL for your web page.

- Configure Vercel to listen to GitHub for this codebase by
  [following the steps documented here](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/git#deploying-a-git-repository)
  - It might be confusing at first. Don't worry! Just follow the steps
    carefully.
- **[git push](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository)**
- Visit the public URL after the push has been successful and Vercel has
  finished deploying
  - Find it in your Vercel dashboard
  - Once configured, every time GitHub gets new code on this repository, Vercel
    will deploy the new code.
