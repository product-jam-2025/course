# 02 - Web Application

**Due November 27**

The goal of the assignment is to get familiar with the web application starter
kit, which you will also use to build the final project in the course.

## Submission

- [Submit your assignment here](https://github.com/product-jam-2025/course/issues/3)
- [Review the assignment submission process here](https://github.com/product-jam-2025/course#assignments)

## Setup

1. Create your own copy of the
   [starter kit repository](https://github.com/product-jam-2025/starter-kit).

   - Give your repository a name that is unique to you, for example
     `yonatan-app`
   - Make sure your copy lives under your own username, i.e.:
     `https://github.com/<your_user>/<repo_name>`

2. Clone the remote repository to your local computer using Git from your
   development machine:
   - **[`git clone`](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)**
3. Visit the repository directory on your local filesystem, and open it in VS
   Code
   - [via the command line](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/command-line#_launching-from-command-line)
   - or [via the app](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/basics)
4. You should now have VS Code open at the folder of the Git repository that you
   cloned from your GitHub account. Click on the `README.md` file to open it in
   VS Code.
5. Follow the instructions in the `README.md` file to:
   - Install project dependencies
   - Run the server
   - See the running app in a browser

## Tasks

### 1. React Tic-Tac-Toe (X-O)

- Create new page at the route `/tic-tac-toe`. Copy `demos/00_blank` to use as a
  starting point.

- Implement the game of Tic-Tac-Toe (X-O) in React. You can
  [follow the tutorial](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe) in React's
  quick start guide, up to "Declaring a winner". (No need to complete the last
  chapter "Adding time travel", but you are welcome to do so if you wish).

- Style the game using
  [CSS modules](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/styling)
  to make it look nice.

### 2. Data fetching & plotting

### 3. Design to code

## Deployment

After completing the tasks above, you should deploy your website with Vercel:

1. Upload to GitHub

   Once you have made the changes you want, and your code works locally, you
   need to `commit` your changes with Git, and `push` your changes to GitHub.

2. Deploy with Vercel

   We use [Vercel](https://vercel.com) to host all our web pages and apps on the
   Internet. Pushing code to a web hosting service is generally called
   "deployment". The steps below need to be completed in order to deploy your
   code to Vercel, and thereby get a public URL for your web page.

   - Configure Vercel to listen to GitHub for this codebase by
     [following the steps documented here](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/git#deploying-a-git-repository).
     It might be confusing at first. Don't worry! Just follow the steps
     carefully.
   - [`git push`](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository)
   - Visit the public URL after the push has been successful and Vercel has
     finished deploying. You can find it in your Vercel dashboard
   - Once configured, every time GitHub gets new code on this repository, Vercel
     will deploy the new code.
