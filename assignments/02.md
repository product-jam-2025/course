# 02 - Web Application

**Due November 27**

The goal of the assignment is to get you to do some basic HTML and CSS editing
to create a web page, and then deploy that to the web. This will demonstrate a
basic understanding of our
[Starter Kit](https://github.com/digital-product-jam-2024/starter-kit) for
development, and some fundamentals of HTML and CSS.

## Submission

- [Submit your assignment here](https://github.com/digital-product-jam-2024/course/issues/2)

# Tasks

## 1. Create your own web page

- [Use our Starter Kit Template](https://github.com/digital-product-jam-2024/starter-kit)
  to create a new repository on Github, under your username, for your web page.
- **Content**: remove the demo content and add your own instead. It can be about
  yourself, a pet, or anything, it doesn't matter.
- **HTML**: Use all of the following HTML elements in your page, with your new
  content ([see our reference materials for HTML](./../reference/html.md)):
  - `<div>` `<p>` `<br>` `<a>` `<ul>` `<h1>` `<img>` `<strong>` `<em>`
    `<iframe>`
- **CSS**: Use CSS to add some styling to your html markup
  ([see our reference materials for CSS](./../reference/css.md)):
  - Give the entire page a different "background color"
  - Change the "font size" of all content inside `<h1>` elements
  - Change the "font family" of all content inside `<p>` elements
- **JavaScript**: Use JavaScript to create a very simple interaction
  ([see our reference materials for JavaScript](./../reference/javascript.md)).
  Some simple ideas you could try:
  - Toggle between "showing" or "hiding" multiple HTML elements, when a website
    visitor clicks a button
  - Change the "background color" of the page, and the "color" of all text, when
    a visitor clicks a (different) button
- **Git**: Once you have made the changes you want, and your code works locally,
  you need to "commit" your changes with Git, and "push" your changes to GitHub
  ([see our reference materials for CSS](./../reference/git.md)).

## 2. Deploy your web page

We use [Vercel](https://vercel.com) to host all our web pages and apps on the
Internet. Pushing code to a web hosting service is generally called
"deployment". The steps below need to be completed in order to deploy your code
to Vercel, and thereby get a public URL for your web page.

- Configure Vercel to listen to GitHub for this codebase by
  [following the steps documented here](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/git#deploying-a-git-repository)
  - It might be confusing at first. Don't worry! Just follow the steps
    carefully.
- **[git push](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository)**
- Visit the public URL after the push has been successful and Vercel has
  finished deploying
  - Find it in your Vercel dashboard
  - Once configured, every time GitHub gets new code on this repository, Vercel
    will deploy the new code.

## 3. Review reference materials

To complete this assignment, you will need to use the reference materials you
were asked to read last week. Here they are again:

- [HTML](./../reference/html.md)
- [CSS](./../reference/css.md)
- [JavaScript](./../reference/javascript.md)
- [Git](./../reference/git.md)

**If you have any trouble with this assignment, do not hesistate to (a) ask
classmates for help, or (b) attend office hours for this week. It is crucial to
get this setup done as soon as possible.**

## Bonus

More advanced reading and exercises can be done by following these tutorials
(not required, but will be very helpful for the course):

- [React Foundations](https://nextjs.org/learn/react-foundations)
