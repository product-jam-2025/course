# 00 - Setup

**Due October 30**

You need to configure all required software for the course, and also to review
some basic reference materials.

## Software setup for the course

In order to have all the required software for this course, you must follow this
setup guide completely.

### Apps

#### VS Code

We are using VS Code for our code editor. You may have other personal
preferences, but please use VS Code for this course. It has superior support for
JavaScript and React development, and our starter kit for web development in
this course is configured to leverage VS Code functionality.

- **[Install VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)**

VS Code has an extensive ecosystem of extensions. Please install the following
extensions (we may not use them all):

- **[ES Lint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)**
- **[HTML CSS](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ecmel.vscode-html-css)**
- **[Live Share](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare)**
- **[GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot)**
- **[GitHub Copilot Chat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot-chat)**

### Chrome or Chromium

Different web browsers hav varying levels of support for web standards. We will
be using Google Chrome for this course, but you can use Chromium if you prefer.

- **[Install Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)**
- **[Install Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/get-the-code/)**

Chrome/Chromium has an extensive ecosystem of extensions. Please install the
following extensions (we may not use them all):

- **[React Dev Tools](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi)**
- **[JSON Formatter](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/json-formatter/bcjindcccaagfpapjjmafapmmgkkhgoa)**

## Websites

You need active accounts on the following websites. **Create your GitHub account
first**, and use it to log in to the other services.

- **[Github](https://github.com)** - We use this to host our code and submit
  development assignments.
- **[Vercel](https://vercel.com)** - We use this to deploy our code as a web
  application, accessible on the public Internet.
- **[Supabase](https://supabase.com)** - We use this as a database services for
  our web application.

Additionally, please bookmark the following websites:

- **[Phind](https://www.phind.com)** - An interface for pair programming with
  AI.
- **[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)** - A large library of high
  quality resources for web development.
- **[React](https://react.dev)** - Documentation for react, a user interface
  library we will be using.
- **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org)** - Documentation for Next.js, a framework for
  building web applications with React.

## Development software

We are writing all our code in JavaScript. All browsers have a built in
JavaScript runtime. Additionally, some of our code needs to run on a server, and
for that we need a JavaScript runtime for our local development - Node (we will
talk in the course about client-server architecture in the context of web
development).

- **[Node LTS v18](https://nodejs.org/en/download)** - Node is a JavaScript
  runtime. We will use it to run our server-side code.
- **[Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)** - Git
  is for version control. We will use it to manage our code.

## Verification

Once you have installed all the required software, please verify that everything
is working correctly. Below is a minimal set of steps to perform in order to do
that.

1. Email your GitHub username to teaching staff. Once you do this, they will add
   you to the GitHub organization for this course, and you will then be able to
   perform the rest of the steps.

## Tasks

- Email your GitHub username to teaching staff
- Once you have access on GitHub, create a comment on the
  [assignment issue thread](https://github.com/digital-product-jam-2024/course/issues/1)
  with the following information:
  - Your full name
  - Your email address
  - Your GitHub username
  - Your Vercel username
  - Your Supabase username
  - The output of running the `node -v` command in your terminal
  - The output of running the `npm -v` command in your terminal
  - The output of running the `code -v` command in your terminal
  - Did you complete all the verification steps at the end of the setup guide?
    Yes/No
- Read some of the linked references from the following reference materials:
  - [HTML](./../reference/html.md)
  - [CSS](./../reference/css.md)
  - [JavaScript](./../reference/javascript.md)
  - [Git](./../reference/git.md)
- More advanced reading can be done by following these tutorials (not required,
  but will be very helpful for the course):
  - [React Foundations](https://nextjs.org/learn/react-foundations)
  - [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app)

**If you have any trouble with this assignment, do not hesistate to (a) ask
classmates for help, or (b) attend office hours for this week. It is crucial to
get this setup done as soon as possible.**
