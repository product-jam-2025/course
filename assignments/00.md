# 00 - Setup

Please configure all required software for the course and review some basic
reference materials.

## Development Environment

Please install the following on your computer:

- [Node LTS v20](https://nodejs.org/en/download) - Node is a JavaScript runtime.
  We will use it to run our code during development.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) - Git is
  for version control. We will use it for managing and deploying our code.

## Google Chrome - Web Browser

Different web browsers have slight differences between them. You may use any
browser you like while developing, but you must make sure your websites work as
expected on Google Chrome.

## VS Code - Code Editor

We will be using VS Code as our code editor. You may have other preferences, but
please use VS Code for this course. It has superior support for JavaScript and
React development, and the starter kit you will get is configured to leverage VS
Code functionality.
