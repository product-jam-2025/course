# Tasks

## 1. Implement one end to end functionality

The exact implementation is team dependant.

The goal is to have you, as a team, implement one functional unit of work related to your project. There is no emphasis on design implementation at this stage. Here are some examples:

- **Do you need to pull data or content from a 3rd party API?** Write the server code to do that, and render that data to the page in some way that makes sense for your project (styling is not crucial).
- **Do you need to implement a chatbot?** Get a basic chatbot framework configured and running in a page, with some initial, static interactions (a greeting, a reponse to dummy user input).
- **Do you need to implement an interactive form for user input?** Implement the basic components of the form and how to transition from at least one stage to another.

If your team is unsure what to tackle, please ask for help during class.
